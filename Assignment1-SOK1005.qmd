# Assignment 1 - reading static web pages 

Use Quarto and prepare a small HTML report of the following task with a February 03, 2025 deadline. Store your code in your GitHub repository, and submit the link in Canvas. This is a compulsory assignment. 

\
\

On the web page:

 <https://www.drroyspencer.com/latest-global-temperatures/>

\

We find a figure of the latest global temperature 

(data at the bottom of page):\

\
\

Download the four data series, i.e., temperature measurements at the four different atmospheric locations: the Lower-Troposphere, Mid-Troposphere, Tropopause, and Lower-Stratosphere. Each dataset is found using its unique URL. 

\

Use only the Global temperature from each dataset (i.e., the third data column). 

For each of the four locations in the atmosphere, calculate the **12-month(right-aligned) moving average** (or mean) (you can run **?zoo::rollmean** in the R console to understand what the **right-aligned average** means**)** using all the available data points. Also, calculate a new variable called **Average**, which is the average of the four 12-month moving averages. Make a plot of the four atmosphere locations and their **Average** in the same plot. Note, the original data points are not to be used in the plot. Include labels identifying the location of the temperature measurements, and the **Average**. You should only use data from January 1980 and onwards in the plot. 

\

Add an appropriate main title and labels to the axis of the plot. Modify and use the R code we have been utilizing in class. The R code should replicate your plot when executed (run) from top to bottom. 

\
\

**Some general considerations**

You should not submit a .zip file, or many files containing the data. **Submit one file with your code**. Your code should be general, meaning that you read the data from the source, i.e. the URL’s, do all the data wrangling, and make the plot.

**Note**

This assignment submission is obligatory. If you fail to meet the deadline without providing a notice from a medical doctor that you are not able to meet the deadline, you are not eligible to submit a data science project. \
